# CodeSprint-8hr-Series

Welcome to my Machine Learning Weekend Challenge! Every weekend, I undertake a new machine learning project and develop it from scratch within 8 hours. The goal of this initiative is to continuously learn, improve my coding and machine learning skills, and better understand my capacity for project execution within a strict timeframe. 

This main repository serves as an index for all the projects I've completed as part of this challenge. For each project, I create a separate repository containing all the relevant code, data, models, and a comprehensive README to explain the project in detail. 

## Structure of the Challenge

Every challenge is divided into two 4-hour sessions over the weekend:

* **Saturday (4 hours):** Understand the problem, design the solution, and begin coding.
* **Sunday (4 hours):** Finish coding, test the solution, and spend the last 2 hours documenting and presenting the work on GitHub.

## Challenge Projects

Here are the projects that I've completed as part of this challenge:

1. [Project 1](url-to-project-1) - A brief description of project 1
2. [Project 2](url-to-project-2) - A brief description of project 2
3. [Project 3](url-to-project-3) - A brief description of project 3
...

## Reflections

At the end of every month, I reflect on the projects I've completed and write a brief summary of what I learned and areas I want to improve. Here are my monthly reflections:

* [January Reflections](url-to-january-reflections)
* [February Reflections](url-to-february-reflections)

For a more visual presentation of my projects, you can visit my [GitHub Pages Website](url-to-github-pages).

I welcome any feedback, suggestions, or collaborations. Feel free to reach out or contribute to any of the projects. Enjoy exploring!
